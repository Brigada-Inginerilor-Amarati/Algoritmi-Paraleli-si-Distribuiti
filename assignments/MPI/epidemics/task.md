Implement a parallel version using MPI.

The initial configuration is read from a input file and the final configuration is saved in a output file.  The program must work if it is deployed with all processes on the same localhost, as well as with processes deployed on several hosts! 

Make sure that serial and parallel versions always produce the same results!

Implement efficient patterns of communication between processes. Use collective communication operation where appropriate.

Measure Speedup for different input sizes.
