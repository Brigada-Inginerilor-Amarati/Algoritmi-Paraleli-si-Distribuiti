## OpenMP: Bacteria Colony (max 20 points)

## Problem description
Simulate the evolution of a colony of bacteria grown on a rectangular culture surface.

The general problem description is the same as Assignment1 - Variant Bacteria. Given the initial bacterial seeding, determine the final configuration after G generations. Implement parallel versions using OpenMP.

Initial configurations are loaded from files. The first line contains the number of rows and columns. Starting with the second line, each character represents a grid point: `X` (bacterium) or `.` (empty).

Example input files: `bacteria-data.zip`.

Bare sequential code: `bacteria-algorithm.c`.

## Requirements
Implement a program that determines the final configuration in both serial and parallel versions.

Command line arguments: input file name, number of generations, number of threads (for parallel versions).

Parallel versions use OpenMP. For full points, implement 4 versions:
- V1: `parallel for`; investigate scheduling policies and chunk sizes
- V2: `parallel for` with threads created once at the beginning
- V3: manual explicit data partitioning
- V4: OpenMP tasks

## Validation and modes
- Automatic validation: each parallel versionâ€™s final configuration must match the serial version.
- Modes: DEBUG (print grid after each generation) and normal (no printing) for performance.

## I/O
Output files: for input `f.txt`, produce `f_serial_out.txt` and `f_parallel_omp_Vn.txt` (n is the version number).

Only final results are saved; intermediate generations are not saved.

## Performance
- Measure serial and parallel runtimes; compute speedup (exclude I/O time).
- Repeat for different grid sizes and thread counts; plot speedup vs threads for multiple grid sizes; discuss results.

## Grading
- Working program with required input format: 2 points
- Parallel version V1: 4 points
- Parallel version V2: 4 points
- Parallel version V3: 4 points
- Parallel version V4: 4 points
- Time measurements, validation, speedup graphs, discussion (all variants): 2 points

Notes:
- Your submitted code must at least compile. Code with compilation errors gets zero points.
